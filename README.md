# Rubiks cube project

This is a hobby project of mine, where the goal ist to recreate a Rubiks cube with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The cube is built using CSS 3d transforms and custom properties. I used quite a lot of JS to get the cube to move just like a real rubiks cube.

If you are on a touchscreen device, you can flick the cube sides with your finger to solve the cube. On desktop pcs there are buttons to do that.
